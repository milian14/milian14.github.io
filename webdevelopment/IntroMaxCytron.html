        Hi, my name is Max Cytron, I am currently a Junior in the IT program at Mizzou. I have taken a Web Dev class in a previous semester. I have made a few basic websites using html, CSS, and some JavaScript. None of these sites had really any major content besides functionality. I expect this class to help me take a more stylized approach to website design, while also improving their functionality. With all my learned skills I would like to move into a tech space of some sort, I plan to apply for jobs that involve some front-end development, while primarily focusing on back end. I also would like to incorporate my web development skills with some of my favorite hobbies such as guitar, video games, and cooking. I would love to make a website that can include all of these hobbies to help show the kind of person I am.
