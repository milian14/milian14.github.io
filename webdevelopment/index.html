        <p>Welcome to my personal portfolio website! I'm excited to share my journey and showcase the
            projects, skills, and experiences that define my passion and dedication in the world of
            technology. Explore my work, get to know me better, and feel free to reach out for collaborations
            or inquiries. Thank you for visiting!
        </p>
        <p>This website will properly display and represent all the projects and
            accomplishments throughout my education career to date. My main goal with this project is to
            truly design a fluid website that showcases my growth not only as a developer, but as a young
            professional as well. I want this website to properly display to future viewers my creativity along
            with my knowledge of design principles and UX design. This website will be at the very heart of
            it a project to show off itself. I want the viewer to be wowed and interested to keep pursuing
            within the website. The site itself will be one of my more advanced projects and it will show as
            such. The dynamic interface will allow my viewers to understand my strengths with front end
            design, while my various other projects can show off my work within the cybersecurity,
            database, and app development field.
