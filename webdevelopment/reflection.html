        <h3>My Personal Philosophy</h2>
            <p style="text-indent: 25px;" class="reflection-pg">
        I have always been a strong believer that hard work pays 
        off. Starting with my high school career, I was the 
        president of my STEM program, worked two jobs, and 
        played a varsity sport. Since the age of 14, I have 
        worked in construction and landscaping in my off-season.
        I have never found a reason why a hard day's work would 
        not be worth it. The hours were long, but the reward 
        ultimately paid off. I learned many valuable skills that 
        otherwise would have never been attainable. This included 
        basic construction skills, masonry, and basic plumbing. 
        Once I got my license, I picked up my second job of my 
        adolescence, delivering sushi. This job taught me a new 
        set of skills that introduced me to the customer service 
        field. The expectation was that I would answer phones and 
        communicate with back-of-house staff to complete orders. 
        I am gracious that I was able to learn such a variety of 
        skills at such a young age. </p>
	    <p style="text-indent: 25px;" class="reflection-pg">
        Moving forward to my college education I jumped at 
        the opportunity to join the engineering school. I knew 
        this would not be an easy task, but from my previous 
        experience, if I worked hard, I would be successful. 
        I was exactly right; I managed to keep my GPA above 
        3.0 to date, while also pursuing other extracurricular 
        activities. By the end of my freshman year, I found it
         time to get a job; I found a sales job working at a 
         local leasing office. Since my tenure began, I have been 
         able to improve upon so many skills that I never would've 
         been able to acquire without being face-to-face with 
         clients. With the hours and dedication I have put into 
         this career, I have attained top agent status in the 
         24-25 leasing year and generated over one million 
         dollars in revenue to date.</p> 
	    <p style="text-indent: 25px;" class="reflection-pg">
        My academic career has not been the smoothest ride, 
        but by putting my head down and working hard, I have 
        succeeded overall. I am ambitious if not anything. 
        I originally entered the university only pursuing a 
        bachelor's degree, but soon found myself striving 
        for more. It started with a minor in mathematics, which 
        required only a few extra courses than required. I soon 
        found out how easy it was to get certificates after that. 
        Once I began researching, I found several that would be 
        easy to get. Once I was down the rabbit hole, there was 
        no leaving. By putting more dedication and focus into 
        degree structure, I found a path that best set me up 
        for success now and in the future. 
	    All the work I have ever done or plan to do has been 
        thought out as far as my understanding allows me to. 
        I put as much effort and dedication into each and every 
        aspect of everything I do. Whether it is a sales 
        appointment or a website I am building, I take each and 
        every facet of my life seriously and put a hard-working 
        mentality into it. </p>
