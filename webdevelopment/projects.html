                One of the most rewarding projects I've had the opportunity to undertake was the creation of a dynamic Tic Tac Toe webpage. This project showcased both front-end and back-end development prowess, offering users a fully functional gaming experience.
On the front end, I crafted an interactive Tic Tac Toe game using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This allowed for seamless gameplay with features such as tracking the game's progress, determining winners and losers, and providing an option to restart for continuous enjoyment.
However, the real challenge and highlight of the project came with the implementation of back-end functionality. Here, I leveraged powerful technologies like bcrypt for secure password encryption and MongoDB for database management. Each user's vital information, including usernames and securely encrypted passwords, was meticulously stored in the MongoDB database. This ensured robust security measures while maintaining user privacy and data integrity.
In essence, this project not only honed my technical skills but also provided a comprehensive understanding of full-stack development, demonstrating my ability to seamlessly integrate front-end and back-end components to deliver a polished and engaging web experience.

                One of my favorite projects was my first front and back end blog website I designed at Mizzou. I created a login page that allowed for a user to save their information, while encrypting their chosen password. My backend ran solely on MongoDB and saved all relevant information ranging from users to blog posts themselves. Each post was able to be fully uploaded, changed and deleted. My passwords were encrypted using a bcrypt system run through javascript. Along with the base html and javascript I also used bootstrap framework and node.js. The design of the website was meant to show off all relevant web development skills from design to fruition.

                I've had the fantastic opportunity to delve into the world of Adobe Suite, where I honed my skills primarily in Photoshop and After Effects. One standout project involved leveraging non-copyrighted footage to unleash my creativity in adding captivating effects and precise masking techniques.
Through meticulous layering of effects, I was able to accentuate the focal points of the footage, effectively highlighting the subject matter with finesse. Moreover, I infused a dramatic flair into the otherwise mundane content, injecting a dynamic and visually striking element that captivated audiences.
This project serves as a testament to my comprehensive proficiency in utilizing Photoshop and After Effects to their fullest potential, showcasing my ability to transform raw footage into visually compelling and immersive multimedia experiences.
