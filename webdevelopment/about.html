            <p>My name is Max Cytron, I am currently pursuing a 
                degree in Information Technology
                from the University of Missouri (Mizzou). 
                I am originally from Montclair, New Jersey 
                where my STEM journey began. <br>I was the 
                president of my high school's <strong>STEM</strong> 
                (Science, Technohlogy, Engineering, and Math)
                program where I led fundraisers and project design. 
                With my help we were able to expand our STEM program 
                and offer various scholarships to some of our students 
                that still exist to date. After being admitted to the
                IT program at Mizzou I have been lucky enough to work 
                on several projects ranging from web development, app 
                design, and algorithm work. Along with my bachelor 
                degree I am also pursuing a minor in mathematics along 
                with certifications in cybersecurity, 
                information science, web app and mobile design, 
                and media technology and design.<br>A favorite quote 
                of mine is</p> 
                <blockquote>“Life is 
                trying things to see if they work."<br>-Ray Bradbury</blockquote>
